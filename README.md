## CodeCrafter's ["Build Your Own SQLite" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/sqlite).
In this challenge, you build a barebones SQLite implementation that supports
basic SQL queries like `SELECT`. Along the way, learn about
[SQLite's file format](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html), how indexed data
is
[stored in B-trees](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/10/02/how-does-sqlite-work-part-2-btrees/)
and more.
